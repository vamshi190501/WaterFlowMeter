# WaterFlowMeter
IoT Based Water Flow Meter

As the water level is decreasing day by day, effective water management has become a necessity. There are many methods for calculating water flow, as well as various types of water flow meters used to measure the amount of water flow in pipelines, but they are all too expensive. Instead of these expensive water flow meters, we can use readily-available and low-cost YFS201 Water Flow Sensor. Apart from measuring water flow, this sensor can be used in Soft Drinks Industries and Chemical industries to continually measure and quantify the liquids that they are handling during this automation process.

We are going to build an IoT based water flow meter using the YFS201 water flow sensor and NodeMCU. It will calculate the flow rate and quantity of water and send it to the cloud (Thinger.IO) to monitor the consumption of water. 

The entire details of the setup, components and working flow are available at the below reference link.
